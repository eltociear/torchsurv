# Development notes

## Set up a development environment via conda

To use conda to install all package dependencies locally and start development,
run the following commands in the root directory of the repository.

Create the environment:

```bash
conda create -y -n torchsurv python=3.10
conda env update -n torchsurv -f dev/environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate torchsurv
```

## Test and develop the package

To run all unit tests either use `dev/run-unittests.sh` or run the 
following command from the repository root directory:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

To run other scripts within the repo, you can run the following
from the top level directory of the repository clone, and then run
scripts from there that import `TorchSurv`. Alternatively you may give
an absolute path to the source directory.

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=src
```

To test building the package, run:

```bash
python -m build # builds the package as a tarball -> dist
```

To get a local installation for testing e.g. other tools that depend on `TorchSurv`
with a local development version of the code:

```bash
pip install -e <repo-clone-directory>  # install for development ("editable")
```

## Installing a local package build

To install a specific package build e.g. into a local conda environment / virtualenv:

```bash
python -mbuild
# ... activate virtualenv
# install the first tarball in dist
pip install "$(set -- dist/*.tar.gz; echo "$1")"
```

## Code formatting

We use `black` for code formatting. To format the code, run the following command:

```bash
./dev/codeqc.sh
```

Code should be properly formatted before merging with `dev` or `main`.

## Build and test the documentation locally

We use Sphinx to build the documentation. To build and view the documentation,
run the following script:

```bash
# just run ./dev/build-docs.sh to build but not start a webserver
./dev/build-docs.sh serve
```

You can then access the documentation at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

When updating toctrees / adding content you may need to clean your local documentation
build:

```bash
cd docs
make clean
```

To build a single PDF of the documentation, run:

```bash
cd docs
make latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent -f"
```

There are a few errors in the PDF build due to layout issues,
but the PDF can still be used to summarize the package in a single
file.
